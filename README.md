# Bit_Sindri_College_Website

I have created a college website for my Nexus Problem Statement using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, and some of the libraries of JavaScript. I have also redesigned the Bit Sindri logo On the main page of the website, I have added links that direct users to multiple pages, such as Technical Clubs, Cultural Clubs, Sports Clubs, the Admission Process page, and the Departments page. The clubs' pages are accessible by hovering over the images on the Society page. 

I have designed a navbar that allows users to smoothly scroll to different sections of the page when they click on any of the elements. Additionally, when users scroll over the "BIT Sindri" section on the intro page, the video of platinum jubilee starts playing in the background. There is also a glow effect on the college motto when hovered over.

The "About Us" section highlights BIT Sindri's glorious history, and also I have added changing photos with the about us page and I’ve used Swiper JS to showcase some of the college's memories. Further down the page, I’ve created a continuous scrolling animation to encourage others to take admission in our college. There is also a section where I used JavaScript to create a glow effect, so when you hover over the text "BIT Sindri," each letter glows with continuously changing colors. To finish it off, I’ve added a footer.

When users navigate to the Department page, I’ve implemented a similar Swiper JS animation and added separate thumbnails for different branches. I have also created individual pages for each society, outlining their vision and the events they conduct.

Lastly, I’ve designed a separate Admission Process page, where I’ve detailed the entire admission process for BIT Sindri in four phases using HTML and CSS.

So, this is the thorough explanation about the project which I have worked upon.
